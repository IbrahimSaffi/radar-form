    <h1>Trader Opportunities with Radar Fx Fund</h1>
    <h2>Radar Fx Fund Is Actively Hiring Traders </h2>
    <h3>We are definitely interested in you if you meet the following criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You are an experienced independent trader in forex, commodity futures, equity futures, bond futures, crypto,
            or any options</li>
        <li>You have one or more strategies that generate 5%+ per month on average, with a 10% max Drawdown and at least
            10 winning months per year, most years.
        </li>
        <li>You seek to apply your proprietary strategy on larger accounts than are currently available to you.</li>
        <li>You are wiling to trade on a paper (demo) account so that we can see your results.</li>
        <li>You are willing and able to trade on Interactive Broker’s platform. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of trading for Radar Fx Fund: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>
                Compensation:
            </b>
            If you are like most of our traders, you will keep 50-60% of your profits, most months, depending upon your
            returns, up to 75% during particularly strong months. The percentage payout you earn will vary each month
            depending on your performance, with a higher percentage being paid for stronger returns. For example, if you
            generate 8% profit in a month, you will receive a 45% payout; if you generate 10% profit in a month, you
            will receive 55% payout; 15% profit yields 65% payout; and 20% profit yields 75% payout. There are
            additional tiers within these ranges, but this gives you a good idea. </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Account Size:
            </b>
            Your trading capital may grow rapidly, depending upon your returns, because as you generate returns, your
            account will increase directly in accordance with your gains, until you reach 3x-5x your starting capital,
            sometimes higher. Thereafter, your account size will still continue to grow with your returns, but at about
            half the rate. This is because by the time your account size gets that big, we will need to withdraw your
            compensation out of your trading account each month to pay you. Prior to that point, we will pay you monthly
            from new capital inflow to the fund. We do not cap account size unless or until it becomes so big that it
            affects returns, so there is no set limit.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Autonomy:
            </b>
            You will trade from your own machine and will never need to share your strategy with us. You will not need
            to have trades approved before you take them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
        <li>You manage your own risk. We have no set rules.
        </li>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Hours: </b>
            You will set your own hours and your own schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Vacation/Holiday:
            </b>
            You will take days off when you want. You will take as much vacation as you wish, even months at a time.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Location:</b>
            You can live anywhere in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Education:</b>
            You need no specific degree or education level.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Prior Experience:</b>
            You need no prior experience trading for a hedge fund or financial company of any kind
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fees:
            </b>
            You will never be asked to buy a membership or pay for training or pay any fees of any kind because we are
            not a prop trading firm. We will never ask for money from you. Never.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will never be asked to put up your own trading capital.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b>
        To Be clear:
    </b>
    <p>
        We do not teach you to trade. We provide an opportunity for talented traders with proven trading strategies to
        have much larger accounts than they have access to on their own – and to keep up to 75% of their profits.
    </p>
    <b>
        The Most Common Question:
    </b>
    <p>
        That we Get From Prospective Traders is this: “What is the disadvantage of applying for a job with your fund?”
        The answer is that we might not offer you a contract, for example if you cannot verify your trading returns. But
        if you meet all of the criteria listed above, we will definitely offer you a contract, and you will be trading
        for us in no time.
    </p>
   <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
        
        Please fill out the form below and submit it to us. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Our Fund Manager will contact you by email to let you know next steps, which will involve verification of your trading results via trading a paper (demo) account on Interactive Brokers (IB). We recommend paper (demo) trading for 1-2 months, but if you feel that you can prove your trading skills within 2 weeks, we are open to that, 

    </li>
    <li>
        If you are able to verify your trading through a demo account, then we will offer you a contract

    </li>
    <li>
        You will then be assigned a small account (typically $10,000 - $100,000 depending on the results of your paper trading), possibly more.

    </li>
    <li>
        Your trading capital will increase in accordance with your capital gains, as noted above. 

    </li>
    <li>
        You will be paid monthly through escrow. This means that your payout (based on your account size and average returns) will be sitting in an escrow account in advance, prior to your trading, so that you know that the money is there to pay you in full when the month is over. 
    </li>
   </ul>
